## Values

The Kmesh and its leadership embrace the following values:

- Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future
  reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public
  forums and open repositories.

- Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit
  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

- Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes
  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals. Each
  contributor participates in the project as an individual.

- Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which
  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.

- Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through
  participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership
  positions.

## Membership

The [Community Membership](./community-membership.md)
outlines responsibilities and requirements for different roles in Kmesh.

Currently, the approvers are the governing body for the project. This may
change as the community grows, such as by adopting an elected steering committee.

## Meetings

Regular meetings are described at [Community Meeting](./README.md#community-meeting).

approvers will also have closed meetings in order to discuss security reports
or Code of Conduct violations. Such meetings should be scheduled by any
approvers on receipt of a security issue or CoC report. All current approvers
must be invited to such closed meetings, except for any approvers who is
accused of a CoC violation.

## Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
violations by community members will be referred to the CNCF Code of Conduct
Committee. Should the CNCF CoC Committee need to work with the project on resolution, the
approvers will appoint a non-involved contributor to work with them.

## Security Response Team

The approvers will appoint a Security Response Team to handle security reports.
This committee may simply consist of the approvers Council themselves.  If this
responsibility is delegated, the approvers will appoint a team of at least two 
contributors to handle it. The approvers will review who is assigned to this
at least once a year.

The Security Response Team is responsible for handling all reports of security
holes and breaches according to the [security policy](https://github.com/kmesh-net/community/blob/main/security-team/SECURITY.md).

## Voting

While most business in Kmesh is conducted by "[lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html)", 
periodically the approvers may need to vote on specific actions or changes.
A vote can be taken on [the developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kmesh) or
[community repo issue](https://github.com/kmesh-net/community/issues/new/choose) 
for security or conduct matters. Votes may also be taken at [the developer meeting](./README.md/#community-meeting).
Any approvers may demand a vote be taken.

Most votes require a simple majority of all approvers to succeed, except where
otherwise noted. Two-thirds majority votes mean at least two-thirds of all 
existing approvers.

## Modifying this Charter

Changes to this Governance and its supporting documents may be approved by 
a 2/3 vote of the approvers.
