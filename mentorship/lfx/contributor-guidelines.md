## Contributor Guidance for Google Summer of Code

## General guidelines

* Read the [Contributor Guide](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship) written by the LFX organizers.
* Go through the [LFX 2025 Project Ideas List](./2025/project_ideas.md) and read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Understand the [LFX timeline](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentorship-program-timelines), application process and the project you are applying for, assuming best intentions throughout the period.
* Join our [Slack Channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06BU2GB8NL) and introduce yourself. 
* Ask for any development-related help in the `#kmesh` channel.
* Start your proposal as early as possible following the template below. If you're new to kmesh, try out our [getting started guide](https://kmesh.net/en/docs/setup/quick-start/).
* Solving [good-first-issues](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) will show us that you can be a good LFX contributor. 
* Other form of contributions like helping out on Slack, GitHub issues, and reviewing pull requests are also most welcomed. We'd prefer contributors who can not only contribute to the codebase of kemsh but can also contribute to the community around it.
* We hold [weekly contributor office hours](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/99299011908?password=f4c31ddd-11ed-42ae-a617-3e0842c39c58), which can also be used to get synchronous guidance for your proposal. 
* Make sure to reach out and interact with the mentors to discuss your solution and approach towards a project idea before starting to fill in the proposal.
* Share the proposal link as text, markdown, Google docs or anything else as long as it is easy to share, and will not require anyone to download something.
* Final proposals should be submitted on the Google Summer of Code website before the deadline.

## Picking up and working on issues

* Please feel free to pick up any [good-first issues](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).
* Or, if you feel confident enough, you are welcome to help out with other non-labelled issues as well, but we'd suggest you to start with an easy issue.
* In order to handle the inflow of too many potential contributors and ensure timely resolution of the issues, we will only be assigning issues to contributors. If a PR was already opened to the issue you were trying to solve, do not open a duplicated PR.
* While this might feel like it would lead to a lot of contributors wasting their time on an issue while only one of them will be able to create a final PR, please remember that we'll also be considering the quality of reviews a contributor leaves on other contributors' PRs while reviewing the final proposal, and investigating the issue yourself will help you post good PR reviews. __But please refrain from spamming the PRs with reviews, only good and quality reviews will be considered.__
* Moreover, in this process, you'll also get to explore and get familiar with the codebase of kmesh, which would help you with further issues.
* But still if you feel like you are leaving good reviews on other contributors' PRs but not getting to solve any issues on your own due to the speed at which others come up with the solution, please reach out us on Slack and we'll help find a suitable issue for you.

## Writing your proposal

* Your proposal should contain a clear understanding on how you're going to approach the project idea. Do not worry too much on building a schedule for the whole project, we'll build this together once the mentoring starts.
